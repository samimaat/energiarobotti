## Caveat about the code

The submitted repo is only the backbones of the code. It includes dummy values for keys and tokens to access Twitter's and Google's APIs. Change those to your own and you have a working Python script, which tweets random tweets from your Google Sheets.

## Technologies

Python scripts with Twitter and Google APIs. The script now live in Google Cloud and is run by Google Scheduler. Google Sheets is used to store the tweets and sources.

## Source of tweets
